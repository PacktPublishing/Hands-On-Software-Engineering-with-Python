**Move beyond basic programming and construct reliable and efficient software with complex code**

## What is this book about?
Software Engineering is about more than just writing code — it includes a host of “soft” skills that apply to almost any development-effort, no matter the language, development-methodology or scope of the project. Being a Senior Developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project’s life-cycle. This book walks you through that discovery by walking through the entire life-cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You’ll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be implemented, sometimes starting with nothing, in one of the fastest-growing languages in the world — Python. The details of, and advantages behind a number industry best practices will show why they are best practices. Application of those practices in Python will be laid out, and some Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will, from first principles to complete implementation, implement a High Performance Computing solution.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Learn what happens over the course of a system’s life (SDLC). 
Learn what to expect from the pre-development life-cycle steps. 
Find out how the development-specific phases of the SDLC affect development. 
Uncover what a real-world development process might be like, in an Agile way. 
Find out how to do more than just write the code. 
Learn project-independent best practices exist, and how to use them. 
Find out how to design and implement a High Performance Computing process.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
def SetNodeResource(x, y, z, r, v): n = get_node(x,y) n.z = z n.resources.add(r, v)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
